# Project Jal-Dhan üå±üíß

**[Hackathon Submission] &nbsp; | &nbsp; [Status: Functional Prototype] &nbsp; | &nbsp; [Technology: Android/Kotlin]**

### *Turning Sustainable Farming into Tangible Wealth.*

---

## üî¥ The Problem: The Locked Gate
India's smallholder farmers are the backbone of our nation, yet they are locked out of the global carbon economy. Current Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) systems are prohibitively expensive, complex, and ill-suited for small, fragmented farms. This creates an insurmountable barrier, preventing farmers from earning a stable income from climate-friendly practices like Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) in rice cultivation.

## ‚úÖ Our Solution: The Key
**Jal-Dhan** is the key to unlocking this gate. It is a mobile-first MRV platform that transforms a farmer's simple smartphone into a powerful tool for generating wealth from water conservation. We are building the digital bridge between sustainable practices on the ground and the global demand for credible carbon credits.

## üì± The Prototype: What's Working Now
This repository contains a functional Android prototype that demonstrates the core of our farmer-centric vision.

**Key Features You Can Test:**
*   **Effortless Login:** A simple, clear entry point for the farmer.
*   **Clean Dashboard:** An at-a-glance view of the farm's status and potential earnings.
*   **One-Click Data Capture:** The farmer can log evidence by simply pressing the camera button and taking a photo.
*   **Instant Feedback:** The app provides immediate confirmation and updates the dashboard, creating a rewarding user experience.

## üöÄ The Vision: From Prototype to Platform
What you see is just the tip of the iceberg. The app is the gateway to a powerful, scalable, and trustworthy climate-tech platform.

### How The Full System Will Work
Our end-to-end architecture is designed for trust and scale:

**üì± Farmer App** ‚Üí **‚òÅÔ∏è AI Cloud Backend** ‚Üí **üõ∞Ô∏è Satellite Cross-Verification** ‚Üí **üîó Blockchain Ledger** ‚Üí **üìú Carbon Registries**

1.  **Farmer captures evidence** via the simple mobile app.
2.  **AI Backend** analyzes the geotagged photo to confirm the practice (e.g., water level in the tube).
3.  **Satellite Data (SAR)** is used to cross-verify the wetting and drying cycles of the entire field, making the system incredibly difficult to defraud.
4.  **Verified data** is logged on a blockchain for immutable, transparent auditing.
5.  **Aggregated reports** are automatically generated for carbon standards like Verra, drastically reducing costs for the entire ecosystem.

### Full Technology Stack
| Component | Prototype (Current) | Full Platform (Vision) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mobile App** | Android (Kotlin), XML Layouts | Android (Kotlin), Jetpack Compose, Offline Sync |
| **Backend** | *Simulated in-app* | Python (Flask/Django), REST APIs |
| **Database** | *N/A* | PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial queries |
| **AI / ML** | *N/A* | TensorFlow/PyTorch for image analysis, GDAL for satellite data processing |
| **Verification** | *N/A* | Hyperledger Fabric or a similar permissioned blockchain |

### üìà Future Roadmap
*   **Q1: Pilot Program:** Partner with a Farmer Producer Organization (FPO) to test and refine the app with 100+ farmers.
*   **Q2: Backend Development:** Build the core AI models and the satellite data ingestion pipeline.
*   **Q3: Verifier Dashboard:** Launch a secure web portal for auditors and project managers to review evidence remotely.
*   **Q4: Multi-Crop Expansion:** Adapt the core MRV engine to support agroforestry projects (monitoring tree growth) and other Nature-based Solutions.

## üåç Our Impact Potential
Jal-Dhan is more than an app; it's a vehicle for economic and environmental transformation.
*   **Financial Inclusion:** Creates a new, stable income stream for millions of farmers.
*   **Climate Action:** Sequesters millions of tons of CO2e by incentivizing proven sustainable practices.
*   **Water Security:** Promotes methods that can reduce agricultural water consumption by up to 30%.
*   **Alignment with NABARD's Mission:** Directly supports the rural economy by creating data-driven, climate-resilient financial products for farmers.
